These images are generated by ID2table.jar.

## VS. 
For 5x6 table, there is really sophisticated service: http://full-combo.herokuapp.com/position

This program supports 4x5, 5x6, and 6x7 tables. (It seems that not implemented yet for US version.)


## Requirement
If you want to use GPU version, CUDA toolkits (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) are required.


## Install

To use GPU, 
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/gumboshi/pzdr_saidai.git
$ cd pzdr_saidai
$ make gpu
```
(Optional) If you know the number of SMX of your GPU, it is better for your system.
```shell
$ make gpu NUM_BLOCK=(4 * number of SMX)
```
You don't need gpu version,
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/gumboshi/pzdr_saidai.git
$ cd pzdr_saidai
$ make
```

## Usage

#### Change table size
To use 4x5 table
```
$ ./pzdr_saidai.exe -small
```
To use 5x6 table (default)
```
$ ./pzdr_saidai.exe -normal
```
To use 6x7 table
```
$ ./pzdr_saidai.exe -big
```

#### Change Leader Skill
Heros (ex. Perseus, Pandora)
```
$ ./pzdr_saidai.exe -hero
```
Lakshmi and Parvati
```
$ ./pzdr_saidai.exe -laku (or -paru)
```
Krishna (Ultimate)
```
$ ./pzdr_saidai.exe -krishna
```
Now available: -hero, -laku(-paru), -krishna, -sonia 

#### Change the number of awoken skills
9 Enhanced ATT, 2 Two-pronged ATT
```
$ ./pzdr_saidai.exe -l 9 -w 2
```
#### Change the number of Orbs
If you specify -s and -e like following, simulation executes 10-20, 11-19, 12-18, 13-17, and 14-16
```
$ ./pzdr_saidai.exe -s 10 -e 14 -normal
```

#### Output 

Default output form is like following, 
```
13-17, line 0, way 0
rank,tableID      ,power
   0,     36923626,    12.750
   1,     36924130,    12.750
   2,     45312202,    12.750
   3,     49049346,    12.750
   4,     49311426,    12.750
   5,     74074853,    12.750
   6,     74075112,    12.750
   7,     74119464,    12.750

  99,    116238594,    12.000
```
tableID corresponds each table. To convert the ID to table, you can use visualization tool,
```
java -jar ID2table.jar
```
or, double click ID2table.jar. 

![big_table](https://github.com/gumboshi/pzdr_saidai/blob/master/file/big_table)
1. change the table size and color
2. input the tableID
3. click "set" button 
![normal_table](https://github.com/gumboshi/pzdr_saidai/blob/master/file/normal_table)
You can save this image by "save" button to same folder as ID2table.jar.


If you specify -ave, 10000 times simulation will execute to evaluate the influence of Orbs which fall from the outside of the table.
```
$ ./pzdr_saidai.exe -ave
```
And also output will be change like following, 
```
13-17, line 0, way 0
rank,tableID      ,power     ,ave power ,min power ,ave combo ,min combo
   0,     36923626,    12.750,    14.977,     8.125,    10.286,     7
